2. Use Node-RED to Subscribe and Publish MQTT Messages

Since Node-RED is running on http://192.168.12.1:1880 after your deploy script, do this:

    Open Node-RED in your browser.

    Add an MQTT input node:

        Set the broker to mqtt://mosquitto:1883 or mqtt://192.168.12.1:1883.

        Subscribe to a topic like test/topic.

    Add a debug node connected to the MQTT input node â€” this will show messages received.

    Deploy the flow.

    Add an MQTT output node to publish a test message to the same topic (test/topic).

    Trigger that node manually or using an inject node.

If your debug panel shows the message you published, MQTT messaging works end-to-end.
3. Sending MQTT Messages from Another Device Connected to Hotspot

Since your hotspot uses subnet 192.168.12.x, any device connected to it should:

    Use MQTT client (e.g., MQTT.fx, MQTT Explorer, or mosquitto_pub/mosquitto_sub tools).

    Connect to MQTT broker at 192.168.12.1:1883.

    Publish and subscribe to the topics you configured (test/topic or your own).

This will verify the network and MQTT broker accept external clients.
