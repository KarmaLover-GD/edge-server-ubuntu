1️⃣ Prepare InfluxDB for Node-RED

Make sure your InfluxDB service is running (you already have edge_data database and edgeuser credentials). We'll use the Node-RED InfluxDB node.

In Node-RED, go to the Palette Manager → install node-red-contrib-influxdb.

Add an InfluxDB out node to your flow.

Configure it:

Server: http://influxdb:8086

Database: edge_data

Username: edgeuser

Password: edgepass

Measurement: use the label field from your decoded data (msg.payload.Label), or a fixed name like vehicle_data.
