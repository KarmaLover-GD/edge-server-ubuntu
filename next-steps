1. Add MQTT and InfluxDB nodes in Node-RED

    Use mqtt in node to subscribe to topics like sensor/temperature

    Use influxdb out node to write to edge_data database

2. In Grafana

    Add InfluxDB as a data source:

        URL: http://influxdb:8086

        DB: edge_data

        User: edgeuser / edgepass

    Create dashboards with queries like:
    
    SELECT value FROM temperature WHERE topic = 'sensor/temperature'
